# Data Engineering Zoomcamp
Repo for my work in DataTalks.Club's _Data Engineering Zoomcamp: A Free 9-Week Course on Data Engineering Fundamentals_ (Course repo at https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp.)

_From the course webpage:_  "Master the fundamentals of data engineering by building an end-to-end data pipeline from scratch. Gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and best practices."

I really like these Zoomcamp courses from DataTalks.Club.  Alexey and the team provide great instruction via YouTube videos and the course materials on GitHub.  The courses are rigorous but achievable.  Highly recommended!
